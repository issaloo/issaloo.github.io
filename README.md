# Issac's Personal Blog

## Updating Blog

### Add new page

```
pelican content -s publishconf.py
ghp-import output -b pages
git push origin pages
```

### How things work

- github pulls from pages branch to deploy website
- pelican is the static website generator

### General Guidelines

Please take a look at the following guides on writing code:

- [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python

### Set Up Development Environment

1. Clone and navigate to the repository

```shell
cd ~/GitHub/issaloo
git clone git@github.com:issaloo/standard-code-quality-workflow.git
cd standard-code-quality-workflow
```

2. Install pdm globally

```shell
pip install pdm
```

3. Install general & development packages with pdm

```shell
pdm install --dev
```

> :information_source: This will install packages [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/), and [gitlint](https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/latest/)

(Optional) Install only the general packages

```shell
pdm install
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```shell
eval $(pdm venv activate)
```

> :information_source: Virtual environment will use the same python version as the system

(Optional) Deactivate the virtual environment

```shell
deactivate
```

### Set Up Standardized Version Control

1. Automate scripts (i.e., linting and autoformatting)
   ```shell
   pre-commit install
   ```
2. Enforce template at commit with pre-commit
   ```shell
   gitlint install-hook
   ```

### Test It Out

1. **Check if `commitizen` is working**

   - :mag_right: Try using commitizen in command line
     1. Add files to staging
     2. Run commitizen
        ```shell
        git cz c
        ```
        Or, if possible
        ```shell
        cz c
        ```
   - :white_check_mark: You should get structured commits

2. **Check if `gitlint` is working**

   - :mag_right: Try writing a bad commit
     1. Add files to staging
     2. Write a bad commit (e.g., `git commit -m 'WIP: baD commit'`)
   - :white_check_mark: You should get a question on whether to continue the commit.

3. **Check if `pre-commit` is working**

   - :mag_right:
     1. Add files to staging, where at least one python file is not formatted well
     2. Run commitizen
        ```shell
        git cz c
        ```
        Or, if possible
        ```shell
        cz c
        ```
   - :white_check_mark: You should get automatic fixes to poorly formatted python files with some errors

   > :information_source: Ctrl+C to exit commit template

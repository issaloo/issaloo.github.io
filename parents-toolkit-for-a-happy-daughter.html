    <p>Now that my daughter is over a year old and becoming more vocal, I’m reflecting on the lessons I want to teach her. My goal is to equip her with the knowledge and skills to build a life of long-term and consistent happiness.</p>
<p>My parents had the same vision for me, emphasizing education, a stable career, a home, and a family. While these external milestones can contribute to happiness, the intangible aspects matter just as much - if not more. Happiness is a mindset, shaped by how we understand ourselves, navigate relationships, and manage our resources. To simplify essential knowledge and skills, I categorize them into three areas: Self, Others, and Resources.</p>
<h3>Self</h3>
<p>Understanding and guiding oneself</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional Awareness:</strong> Recognizing, processing, regulating, and expressing emotions effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Decision-Making:</strong> Balancing logic, emotions, and practicality while considering long-term consequences. The time spent on a decision should match its importance and remain within its window of opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Others</h3>
<p>Building and maintaining relationships
People-Centered Thinking: Prioritizing people over possessions.
Conflict Resolution: Approaching disagreements constructively.
Empathy: Meeting people where they are and understanding their perspectives.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>Managing time and money effectively</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Allocating time wisely to balance present needs with future goals.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Management:</strong> Knowing when to save and spend to ensure financial stability. The specifics, such as 401(k)s and stocks, vary by country and time period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these overlap with mindsets, which I'll leave for another post.</p>
<p>At what points in her life do I teach each of these knowledge and skills and how do I teach them? That’s the challenge.</p>

Title: Why I Have No Hobbies
Date: 2025-01-13 10:23

Hobbies are my way to unwind and disconnect from daily work. Over the years, I’ve explored many with some lasting longer than others.

Some of the hobbies I’ve had in the past:

- Glowsticking
- Water tasting
- Bread-making
- Fishing
- Pickup Basketball
- Ultimate Frisbee
- Hiking
- Product Testing

Now, in the early stages of parenthood, finding the right hobby has become more challenging due to less personal time and more responsibilities at home. But I’m confident that there’s a hobby that fits me at this time. I just have a lot more requirements.

My hobby criteria:

- Costs less than $50 per year (ideally free)
- Produces something personally useful
- Does not add to physical clutter
- No urgency or deadlines
- Can be started and stopped anytime
- Unrelated to work (no tech)
- Can be done at home

Blogging passes most of my criteria, so I’ll try it out.

Is it typical for people to get new hobbies for each life stage?
